# Abstract
Covalent chemistry is a versatile approach for expanding the ligandability of the human proteome. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) can infer the specific residues modified by electrophilic compounds through competition with broadly reactive probes. The extent to which such residue-directed platforms, however, fully assess the protein targets of electrophilic compounds in cells remains unclear. Here, we evaluate a complementary protein-directed ABPP method that identifies proteins showing stereoselective reactivity with alkynylated, chiral electrophilic compoundsâ€”termed stereoprobes. Integration of protein- and cysteine-directed data from cancer cells treated with tryptoline acrylamide stereoprobes revealed generally well-correlated ligandability maps and highlighted features, such as protein size and the proteotypicity of cysteine-containing peptides, that explain gaps in each ABPP platform. In total, we identified stereoprobe binding events for >300 structurally and functionally diverse proteins, including compounds that stereoselectively and site-specifically disrupt MAD2L1BP interactions with the spindle assembly checkpoint complex leading to delayed mitotic exit in cancer cells.
